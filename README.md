--

![ArrowMaster](http://i.imgur.com/Op81Byo.png)

ArrowMaster is a simple Mixed Reality game that accompanies a [beginner's tutorial for HoloLens development in Unity](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/uk_faculty_connection/2017/06/11/an-introduction-to-mixed-reality-game-development-with-hololens-and-unity/).

This repository contains the finished Unity project for the game. It includes a copy of [Microsoft's HoloToolkit for Unity](https://github.com/Microsoft/HoloToolkit-Unity),
as well as a couple of hologram prefabs for the player to interact with.
To try it out, simply clone or download the repository and open it as a project in Unity.

Forks and improvement suggestions heartily welcomed!
